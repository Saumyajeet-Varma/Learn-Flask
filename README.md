# Learn-Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It's used to build web applications quickly and with minimal code.

- Routing: Define URLs and what happens when someone visits them.
- Templating: Uses Jinja2 templating engine to render HTML dynamically.
- Built-in development server & debugger.
- RESTful request handling.
- Easily extendable with plugins (e.g., for databases, authentication, etc.).

## 01) How to make a website with Python

In this section we'll learn how to create routes and redirection.

### Routing
```python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "<h1>This is the Homepage</h1>"
```
You're telling Flask:
> "Hey Flask, when someone visits the root URL /, run the home() function and return whatever it outputs as the response."

```python
@app.route("/user/<name>")    # Dynamic routing
def user(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"
```
> <variable_name> is used in dynamic routing in Flask


### Redirection
For redirection you need to import redirect and url_for from flask.
```python
from flask import redirect, url_for
```

```python
@app.route("/test")
def test():
    return redirect(url_for("home"))
```

```python
@app.route("/another-test")
def test():
    return redirect(url_for("user", name = "Samm"))    # Redirection to dynamic routes
```

## 02) HTML templates

In this section we'll learn how to render proper HTML template

Create a directory in the root folder where your **main.py** is, name that directory **templates**. Inside templates create your HTML files.

Jinja (specifically Jinja2) is the template engine that Flask uses under the hood. <br>
Jinjaâ€™s main job is to dynamically generate HTML by embedding Python-like expressions inside your HTML files.

To render HTML pages, we need **render_template**
```python
from flask import render_template
```

How to use render_template
```python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")
```
You're telling Flask:
> "Hey Flask, when someone visits the root URL /, run the home() function, and send back the rendered HTML content from the index.html file inside the templates folder as the response."

We can also pass template variables
```python
@app.route("/user/<name>")
def user(name):
    return render_template("user.html", name = name, role = "admin", x = 10)
```
> We can pass any datatype as template variables.

How to use template variable in HTML
```html
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
<h4>You are {{role}}</h4>
```

```html
{% for i in range(x) %} 
    {% if i % 2 == 0 %}
        <p>{{i}}</p>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```
> {{ }} is used to show the value. <br> {% %} is used to write python code.
